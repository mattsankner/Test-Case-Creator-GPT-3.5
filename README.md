# Test-Case-Creator-GPT-3.5

This is a notebook created during an internship at Insulet Corporation for purpose of demonstrating use of GPT/AI in increasing test coverage for an app.

Topic: an app that controls delivery and management of insulin to patients with diabetes through a proprietary device worn on the body.

The application revolves around a dataset that outlines specific requirements (or SRS) for the app, corresponding screens, and test cases. By inputting a query related to a specific requirement, the application, through GPT-3.5 Turbo, can generate detailed information about that requirement, including its associated test case. Furthermore, it's equipped to generate a new, unique test case corresponding to the same requirement, ensuring multifaceted test coverage.

Information used is sample public dummy data and is not proprietary/private company data.
